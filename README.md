# Dynamic Pricing Optimization using Price Elasticity of Demand

## Project Overview

This project implements a data-driven **Dynamic Pricing Optimization** model for retail, leveraging **Price Elasticity of Demand** to maximize revenue and quantity sold. In competitive retail environments, static pricing often leads to missed opportunities. This initiative addresses the challenge of optimizing pricing strategies by systematically analyzing historical sales data, understanding customer responsiveness to price changes, and simulating the financial impact of dynamic adjustments.

## Problem Statement

The retail business operates in a competitive market, and its current static pricing strategy may not be fully optimizing revenue. The goal is to develop a dynamic pricing model that optimizes the prices of items to maximize revenue while remaining competitive in the market. This necessitates:

* Analyzing the current pricing strategy and its impact on sales and revenue.
* Comparing our pricing strategy with that of the competition to identify gaps and opportunities.

## Project Objective

The core objective of this project is to develop and validate a dynamic pricing framework that can strategically adjust item prices to significantly improve overall revenue and sales quantity compared to existing pricing strategies. This involves:

* Developing a dynamic pricing model that adjusts prices based on factors such as competitor pricing, demand elasticity, and market trends.
* Implementing and simulating the dynamic pricing model to compare its performance against the existing pricing strategy.
